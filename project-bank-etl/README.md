## üìé Documentation

üìÑ **Capstone_Project.pdf** ‚Äî This PDF is the final project presentation submitted for the **IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate** on Coursera. It documents a complete, end-to-end data engineering workflow covering:

- MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL integration
- Data visualization using Looker Studio
- ETL development using Python and Apache Airflow
- Predictive modeling using PySpark

üß© The Python script in this folder (bank market cap ETL) represents the **"ETL pipeline" module** of that broader capstone project.
It is implemented independently and brings to life one core part of the architecture described in the PDF.
